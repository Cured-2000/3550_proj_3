# 3550_proj_3
For Project 3, you will implement an encryption system in any programming language supported 
on our Linux CSE machines using a modified, simplified version of AES (Advanced Encryption 
System) on our CSE machines that will (1) read the plain text from a file and a key from another file; 
(2) encrypt the plain text according to the requirements detailed below; and (3) write the output for 
each step to the screen and to an output file. Your source code must be sufficiently commented to 
explain your program. At a minimum, you should comment the header (e.g., name, class date, brief 
description of the program), all variables (i.e., what each variable is used for), and specific “blocks” 
of code. This applies to all user-defined functions as well. For example, use comments to describe the 
inputs,  the  formulas  used,  and  any  other  important  steps  in  your  code.  Be  sure  to  handle  any 
applicable error conditions in your code (e.g., if there is a problem opening the file, etc.).
